# Scripts Directory

This directory holds cmdlets that are rarely needed, and are therefore not automatically imported upon terminal startup. They can be manually imported by navigating to the directory and running the following:
```
Import-Module .\<NameOfCmdlet>.ps1 -Force
```

The cmdlet is now imported and ready to use.
